# `klank`

`klank` as it stands is a research-exercise and a framework for my personal projects. 

The goal for this project is to build a deep understanding of backend concepts and the PHP languge as well as an understanding of surronding standards when building dependencies.

This acts as a proof of my working knowledge of PHP and architecture. Going forward, this project will see a lot of heavy changes and it will not be in a ready state for some time.
